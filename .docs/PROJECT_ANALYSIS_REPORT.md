## Project Overview

### Purpose and Scope
roughup is a specialized CLI tool that bridges the gap between source code repositories and LLM consumption. It provides:

1. **Line-range extraction** from multiple files with Windows drive letter support
2. **Symbol extraction** via Tree-sitter AST parsing (Rust, Python, extensible)
3. **Token-aware chunking** using tiktoken-rs for GPT models
4. **Directory tree visualization** with per-file line counts
5. **Gitignore-aware traversal** with deterministic output

### Target Users
- AI/ML engineers working with code analysis
- Developers preparing codebases for LLM ingestion
- Research teams analyzing large codebases
- CI/CD pipelines requiring structured code extraction

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Memory Management**
   - Memory mapping for large files (>1MB threshold)
   - Pre-allocated string capacity based on heuristics
   - Efficient byte slicing without full string allocation
   - AST caching with moka to avoid re-parsing

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Rayon-based file walking and symbol extraction
   - Thread-safe aggregation of results
   - CPU core utilization optimization

3. **I/O Optimization**
   - Single-read per file strategy
   - Streaming iteration over Tree-sitter matches
   - Minimal allocations in hot paths

### Benchmarking Considerations
- **Scalability**: Handles large codebases (tested with multi-thousand file projects)
- **Memory efficiency**: Linear memory usage with file count
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Identical performance on Windows/Unix

---

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns with layered design
   - Trait-based extensibility for language support
   - Consistent error handling with anyhow/thiserror
   - Strategic use of type system for correctness

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - 31 comprehensive tests covering core functionality
   - Cross-platform line ending validation
   - Edge case coverage (empty files, invalid ranges)
   - Integration tests for file system interactions

3. **Documentation**
   - Extensive inline documentation with architectural notes
   - Clear API documentation with examples
   - Comprehensive README with usage patterns

4. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Windows drive letter parsing
   - CRLF/LF handling with test validation
   - Path normalization and resolution

### Technical Debt and Risk Areas

1. **Language Support Limitation**
   - Currently supports only Rust and Python
   - Tree-sitter version dependencies could create upgrade challenges
   - Language detection based on file extensions only

2. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Multiple configuration file formats increase maintenance burden
   - Environment variable naming conventions need documentation

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Limited graceful degradation when Tree-sitter parsing fails
   - Binary dependency on external language grammars

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Posture

1. **Input Validation**
   - Path traversal protection through standard library usage
   - UTF-8 validation on all text processing
   - Range boundary checking for line extraction

2. **Memory Safety**
   - Rust's ownership system prevents common memory vulnerabilities
   - Safe FFI bindings to Tree-sitter C libraries
   - Bounds checking on all array/slice access

3. **File System Access**
   - No privilege escalation or system command execution
   - Read-only access to source files
   - Gitignore respect prevents unintended file access

### Recommendations
- Consider adding file size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Implement timeout mechanisms for large file processing
- Add optional sandboxing for untrusted input

## Critical Issues Identified and Resolved

During the analysis, 4 critical bugs were identified and fixed:

### 1. Off-by-One Error in Symbol Text Extraction
**Location:** `src/core/chunk.rs:322`  
**Impact:** Symbol text extraction was losing the last line in fallback mode  
**Resolution:** Changed exclusive end condition (`i < end_idx`) to inclusive (`i <= end_incl`)

### 2. Path Resolution Bug in Line Number Mapping
**Location:** `src/core/symbols.rs:340`  
**Impact:** File re-reading could fail when CWD != project root  
**Resolution:** Added root parameter threading for absolute path resolution

### 3. Over-Permissive Python Prefix Stripping
**Location:** `src/infra/utils.rs:159`  
**Impact:** Could mis-parse strings with unexpected alphabetic prefixes  
**Resolution:** Restricted to legal Python string prefixes (r,u,f,b combinations)

### 4. Code Duplication in Tree-sitter Utilities
**Location:** Multiple parser files  
**Impact:** Potential drift in behavior between duplicate implementations  
**Resolution:** Consolidated to single `TsNodeUtils::has_ancestor` implementation

All fixes verified with full test suite (31 tests passing) and zero compilation warnings.
